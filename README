"python3 CertAuth.py -h" will give a good understanding of its usage

output of the above is as follows:
>
	usage: python3 CertAuth.py <path for backup private key> <CA public certificate> <subject public certificate> <password for backup private key>

	Sample : python3 CertAuth.py cert_bckup.p12 root.crt subject.crt CSE539_Rocks!

	  arguments   includes file paths and passwords needed for successful
	              execution

	optional arguments:
